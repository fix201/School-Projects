Contains most of my out of class projects

To run most of these files, you need to have 'graph1.h' and 'graphLib2015.lib' or 'graphLib2013.lib'(depending on your visual studio version) in the same directory as the file you want to run.

Lastly you have to have glut library installed on your visual studio, the installation process is shown in the 'Glut Installation' folder.
